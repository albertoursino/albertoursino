## Hi there, this is Alberto Ursino 👋

**Status**: searching for an **open-source project** on which to contribute actively, and a **job** in the field of Software Engineering

**My ideal job**: write Python code every day, and collaborate within a team of software developers to create something that have the potential to make a positive impact on the planet 🌍

**Something about me**:

- 🐍 **Python** is my main programming language
- 🧼 I use **[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)** to keep my code clean
- ⚡ I use **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)** to easily manage my Python environment
- 🎨 I love **tennis**, **videogames** and spending time with **friends**
