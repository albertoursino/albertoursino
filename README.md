# Hi there, this is Alberto Ursino 👋

I’m a passionate, versatile **Software Engineer** from Italy, working at @ KAI (by Infineon) in Villach, Austria.

I love sports, videogames, and spending time with friends. I’ve recently become passionate about finance.

## 👩🏼‍💻 My coding style

- 🐍 **Python** is my favourite programming language
- 🧼 I use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) together with **[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)** and [**Mypy**](https://github.com/python/mypy) to maintain clean and high-quality code
- ⚡ I use **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)** for an efficient Python environment management
- ✨ I'm a perfectionist and conventions enthusiast: I strictly follow [**PEP 8**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and [**Conventional Commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

I’m currently collaborating with three friends on a **C compiler project**. Check it out [**here**](https://github.com/d-u-d-e/c-compiler)!
