## Hi there, this is Alberto Ursino 👋

**Something about me**:

- 🐍 **Python** is my main programming language
- 🧼 I use **[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)** to keep my code clean
- ⚡ I use **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)** to easily manage my Python environment
- 🎨 I love **tennis**, **video games** and spending time with **friends**

I'm currently writing a C compiler along with 3 friends, checkout our [project](https://github.com/d-u-d-e/c-compiler/tree/develop).
