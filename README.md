## Hi there, this is Alberto Ursino 👋

- 💻 Master graduated in **Computer Engineering - Artificial Intelligence & Robotics**
- 🐍 **Python** is my main language
- 🧼 The code should be kept clean; that's why I use **[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)** with **[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)**
- ⚡ Python environments should be easy to manage; that's why I use **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)**
