# Hi there, this is Alberto Ursino 👋

I’m a passionate, versatile Software Engineer working at @[KAI](https://www.k-ai.at/) in Villach, Austria.

I love sports, videogames, and spending time with friends. I also love writing code, of course.

## 👩🏼‍💻 My coding style

- 🐍 Python is my favourite programming language
- 🤖 Always heading towards automation
- 🧼 I like to use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) together with [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) and [Mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) to keep my code clean
- ⚡ I like to use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage my Python environments
- ✨ I'm a perfectionist: I try to follow conventions as much as possible (e.g., [PEP 1](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/), [convetional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/))
