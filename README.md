# Hi there, this is Alberto Ursino 👋

I’m a passionate, versatile software engineer from Italy. I'm actually working on data pipelines and TensorFlow @ KAI by Infineon.

I enjoy sports, video games, spending time with friends, and I’ve recently become passionate about finance.

## Coding style

- 🐍 **Python** is my primary programming language
- 🧼 I use **[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)** and [**Mypy**](https://github.com/python/mypy) to maintain clean and high-quality code
- ⚡ I rely on **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)** for an efficient Python environment management
- ✨ I'm a perfectionist and conventions enthusiast: I strictly follow [**PEP 8**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and [**Conventional Commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

I’m currently collaborating with three friends on a **C compiler project**. Check it out [here](https://github.com/d-u-d-e/c-compiler)!
